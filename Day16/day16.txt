Restrictive Candy Crush

Given a string S and an integer K, the task is to reduce the string by applying the following operation:
Choose a group of K consecutive identical characters and remove them. The operation can be performed any number of times until it is no longer possible.

Example 1:

Input:
K = 2
S = "geeksforgeeks"
Output:
gksforgks
Explanation:
Modified String after each step: 
"geegsforgeeks" -> "gksforgks"

Example 2:

Input:
K = 2
S = "geegsforgeeeks" 
Output:
sforgeks
Explanation:
Modified String after each step:
"geegsforgeeeks" -> "ggsforgeks" -> "sforgeks"


Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|S|)

Constraints:
1 ≤ |S| ≤ 105
1 ≤ K ≤ |S|
