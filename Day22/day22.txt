Shortest Range In BST

Given a BST (Binary Search Tree), find the shortest range [x, y], such that, at least one node of every level of the BST lies in the range.
If there are multiple ranges with the same gap (i.e. (y-x)) return the range with the smallest x.

Example 1:

Input:
              8
          /   \
         3     10
       /  \      \
      2    6      14
          / \     /
         4   7   12
                /  \
               11   13
Output: 6 11
Explanation: Level order traversal of the tree 
is [8], [3, 10], [2, 6, 14], [4, 7, 12], [11, 13]. 
The shortest range which satisfies the above 
mentioned condition is [6, 11]. 


Example 2:

Input:
   12
    \
     13
       \
        14
         \
          15
           \
           16

Output: 12 16
Explanation: Each level contains one node, 
so the shortest range is [12, 16].
