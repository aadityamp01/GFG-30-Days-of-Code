Ruling Pair

Geek Land has a population of N people and each person's ability to rule the town is measured by a numeric value arr[i]. 
The two people that can together rule Geek Land must be compatible with each other i.e., the sum of digits of their ability arr[i] must be equal. 
Their combined ability should be maximum amongst all the possible pairs of people. Find the combined ability of the Ruling Pair.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {55, 23, 32, 46, 88}
Output:
101
Explanation:
All possible pairs that are 
compatible with each other are- (23, 32) 
with digit sum 5 and (55, 46) with digit 
sum 10. Out of these the maximum combined 
ability pair is (55, 46) i.e. 55 + 46 = 101

Example 2:

Input:
N = 4
arr[] = {18, 19, 23, 15}
Output:
-1
Explanation:
No two people are compatible with each other. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105 
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 109

Difficulty: Medium
tags: hash, arrays
