Spiral Matrix

Given a matrix of size N x M. You have to find the Kth element which will obtain while traversing the matrix spirally starting from the top-left corner of the matrix.

Example 1:

Input: 
N = 3, M = 3, K = 4
A[] = {{1, 2, 3}, 
       {4, 5, 6}, 
       {7, 8, 9}}
Output: 
6
Explanation: Spiral traversal of matrix: 
{1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5}. Fourth element
is 6.

Example 2:

Input: 
N = 2, M = 2, K = 2 
A[] = {{1, 2},
       {3, 4}} 
Output: 
2
Explanation: Spiral traversal of matrix: 
{1, 2, 4, 3}. Second element is 2.
