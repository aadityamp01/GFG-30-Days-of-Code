Bit Difference

Given an integer array of size  N . You have to find sum of bit differences in all pairs that can be formed from array elements. Bit difference of a pair (x, y) is count of different bits at same positions in binary representations of x and y.
For example, bit difference for 2 and 7 is 2. Binary representation of 2 is 010 and 7 is 111 ( first and last bits differ in two numbers).

Example 1:

Input: N = 2, arr[] = {1, 2}
Output: 4
Explanation: All possible pairs are [(1,1) (1,2) 
(2,1) (2,2)] their respective Bit differences 
are 0 ,  2 , 2 , 0


Example 2:

Input: N = 5, arr[] = {3, 5, 2, 5, 2}
Output: 36

Expected Time Complexity: O(NlogN)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 108
