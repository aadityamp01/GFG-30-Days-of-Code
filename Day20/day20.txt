Valentine Sum

Cupid wants to strike maximum houses in Geek Land on Valentine's Day. The houses in Geek Land are arranged in the form of a binary tree. Cupid is standing at target node initially. 
Find the sum of all nodes within a maximum distance k from target node. The target node should be included in the sum.


Example 1:

Input:
                   1
                 /    \
                2      9
               /      /  \
              4      5     7
            /   \         /  \
           8     19     20    11
          /     /  \
         30   40   50
target = 9, K = 1
Output:
22
Explanation:
Nodes within distance 1 from 9 are 9, 5, 7, 1  

Example 2:

Input:
                   1
                 /    \
                2      9
               /      /  \
              4      5     7
            /   \         /  \
           8     19     20    11
          /     /  \
         30   40   50
target = 40, K = 2
Output:
113
Explanation:
Nodes within distance 2 from 40 are 40, 19, 50, 4


Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)


Constraints:
1 ≤ N, Node Value ≤ 105
1 ≤ K ≤ 20
